This is a large game I am planning to make to learn Godot. It's a top down rogue-like (kinda?) where you can spent lives to get upgrades after every level.
If i do end up finishing it, it will be a tiny game with ~5 levels and 15 upgrades, but right now I have no idea what the final game will look like.
