This is a small game I am planning to make to re-learn unity. It's a top down rogue-like (kinda?) where you can spent lives to get upgrades after every level.
If i do end up finishing it, it will be a tiny game with ~5 levels and 15 upgrades, but right now I have no idea what the final game will look like.
